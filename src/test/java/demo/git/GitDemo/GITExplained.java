 README.md  ---> what all teh pre-requisite 
 ignore files  --> ignore is completed  				
 git status  --> status of the project. (any unsaved files. any un commited changes, can see branch name)
 git add <filename> ---> to save the file (* represent "all files", git add .gitignore)
 git commit -m "message you want to name" --> to save the changes to git repo
 git push origin master --> to push the code from local to cloud (remote)
 git pull origin master --> to take the changes form cloud to local
 
 git branch <branchname>  --> it will create an branch with its name. Code will be taken from last branch (branch name before creating)
 
 Master -->
 Sri
 Abhi
 jo
 ran
 jo wants to write some code here
 git checkout <branchname>  ---> git will shift or change the branch name
 git branch  --> it will list down the branches which is available locally
 git branch -d <branchname> --> to delete the branch locally
 git branch -r  --> to list down the branch which is there in origin
 
 Best practice :--> as soon as you create an branch good to push it immediatly
 
 PR ---> pull request --> some body pull there code to default branch (master)
 
 //add some junky comments
